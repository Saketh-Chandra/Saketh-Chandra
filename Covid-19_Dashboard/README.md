## Data Source for the project:
The data source for our project is provided by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering
(CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University. The main reason for obtaining the data from them is they
provide the data for free of cost and they also provide authenticated data source as they pool the
information regarding the number of COVID-19 cases registered, number of recoveries, number
of deaths from authenticated and reliable sources like World Health Organization (WHO),
European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) etc.
